# Introduction

Vera is the most powerful open financial platform for non-fungible token (NFT) assets. Vera offers decentralized financing, leasing, lending, and other essential financial services for any NFT marketplace, game, or application.

The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the protocol and how to interact with it. Please join the #development channel in the [Vera community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/fB9nuS2ktf); our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of Vera.

The protocol is implemented as a set of **smart contracts** on top of various blockchains such as Ethereum. Smart contracts guarantee safety and do not require a middleman.
