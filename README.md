# Vera Document Portal

This site provides documentation for Vera which is a universal infrastructure for decentralized finance, that enables peer-to-peer use cases of digital and real-world NFT assets on a cross DLT implementation.

Vera thinks that Buying, Selling, Lending, Borrowing, or Leasing assets as NFTs between strangers should be as easy and accessible as sending an email regardless of your location or who you are.
